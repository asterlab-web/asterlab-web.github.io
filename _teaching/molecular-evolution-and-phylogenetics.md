Advanced course for phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis

Course description
======
Molecular evolution and phylogenetics is a specialized course for students major in the ecology and evolutionary biology. This course introduces the basic concepts and applications in the molecular evolution and phylogenetics area, including the neutral theory, molecular clock and reconstruction of phylogenetic relationship. It helps the students to understand the theoretical basis of utilizing nucleotide or amino acid sequences to reconstruct taxonomy relationship and the evolutionary process and how to apply it into real practice. It is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate students, with basic knowledge of genetics, evolutionary biology and bioinformatics.
