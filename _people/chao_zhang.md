# Biography
Chao has been dedicated in the development of phylogenetic algorithms and tools. He developed ASTRAL-IV (for large-scale phylogenetic inference), ASTRAL-Pro (for phylogenetic inference using multi-copy gene families), wASTRAL (for phylogenetic inference with uncertainty), CASTER (for whole-genome-alignment-based phylogenetic inference), WASTER (for cost-efficient phylogenomic reconstruction), D\* statistic (for detecting ancient hybridization), and TAPER (for multiple sequence alignment error removal).
